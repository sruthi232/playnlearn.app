### 3. Verification Process

## Technical Implementation

### Data Storage
- **Student Redemptions**: `localStorage` key `student_redemptions_{studentId}`
- **Teacher Verifications**: `localStorage` key `teacher_scanned_redemptions`
- **Offline-first design** for village environments with limited connectivity

### QR Code Structure
```json
{
  "id": "unique_redemption_id",
  "studentId": "student_001",
  "productId": "product_id",
  "redemptionCode": "EDU-ABC-1234",
  "token": "one_time_token",
  "timestamp": 1640995200000,
  "expiry": 1641600000000
}
```

### Status Flow
1. **Pending**: QR generated, awaiting teacher verification
2. **Verified**: Teacher approved the redemption
3. **Collected**: Student has received the physical reward
4. **Rejected**: Teacher rejected the redemption
5. **Expired**: QR code expired (default 7 days)

### Security Features
- **One-time tokens**: Prevent QR code reuse
- **Expiry dates**: Automatic expiration after 7 days
- **Unique codes**: Each redemption has a unique identifier
- **Offline verification**: Works without internet connection
